### Comments on California's annual homelessness count
**Summary**
This article described the challenges and limitations of city and county point-in-time counts of their unhoused population, which some conduct yearly. For most local jurisdictions, the count involves teams of hundreds or thousands of volunteers, who walk through a certain segment of the city and tally up the number of people they see that they consider unhoused. This process inevitably leaves out many unhoused individuals; for example, people who are living in overcrowded or temporary living situations would not be counted. Many factors impact the number of people outdoors during the count; law enforcement clearing encampments shortly before the count displaces entire groups of unhoused people, or inclement weather may result in some unhoused people staying in a motel for a single night rather than sleeping outdoors. The innacuracy of the count has significant political implications. Much federal, state, and local funding for homelessness initiatives rely on these counts, and the significant undercount means that those initiatives cannot accurately address the scale of the problem. Though there are no easy alternatives, the homelessness count could be combined with other metrics, such as Department of Education data on unhoused students and data on the number of people who have tried to access housing services.
**Analysis**
I had heard some criticism of the homelessness count in the past, and was interested in learning more this year because the 2021 count was cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns. This provides a unique opportunity to further examine the count process and potentially propose alternatives to it. I also found the homelessness count interesting because of its very spatial nature; the count administrators divide their city or county into small areas, and volunteers walk or drive around their designated areas, tallying up the people they deem to be homeless. I appreciate this "boots on the ground" approach because it recognizes that many aspects of planning cannot be seen except by literally moving through a space. However, the point-in-time approach does not fit the experience of homelessness, which is unstable and constantly on the move - often by force. Additionally, the amount of time and resources necessary to undertake the count creates a constant cycle of conducting, evaluating, and planning for the count. Rather than a rushed but frequent data-gathering process, I believe that this type of data should be conducted less frequently - perhaps every other year, instead of every year - but more methodically and accurately. Although there can be pressure to gather and report as much data as possible, poor data is not only false, but can be misleading. In this situation, particularly considering the urgency of the homelessness crisis, good data science should focus on quality rather than quantity.

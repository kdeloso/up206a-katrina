## Off the Gridâ€¦ and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design

In this paper, Geoff Boeing measures the "griddedness" of American streets, which generally declined after the 1940s as planners began to design for driving and sprawl. This is important because high levels of griddedness are associated with higher rates of active transportation and lower rates of driving, and carry a number of other benefits, including ease of navigation and increased social mixing. Boeing defines street grid as a set of streets that are straight, oriented in the same directions, and have many four-way junctions. To assess griddedness, he downloads street-level data from OSMnx and assemble streets into *nodes* and *edges* that he then evalyates for straightness, orientation, and four-way junctions. He then uses census data to approximate the decade in which development occurred for each census tract, with three different approximation methods to increase accuracy. Boeing found that griddedness was lowest in New England and Appalachia and highest in the Great Plains and the Midwest, reflecting the pace of development and the planning trends of their times. Across all three indicators of griddedness, griddedness declined in the decades following the 1940s, but began resurging in the 1990s, although not to pre-World War II levels.

I was impressed with Boeing's creativity in both developing metrics and evaluation methods for griddedness, and for evaluating the decade of development for census tracts. Despite learning about the rise of curvilinear streets in other transportation courses, I was still surprised to see just how much griddedness declined after World War II, across census tracts and across the many indicators of griddedness. Mostly, however, I was curious to learn more about the planning and public health implications of griddedness. I understand that this wasn't the focus of the paper, but I wanted to understand better what the causal relationship was between griddedness and reduced driving/increased active transportation. Is it mostly that gridded streets tend to be more congested with car traffic and that short blocks are easier to navigate by walking than long blocks? I was also very curious to learn about the emotional, mental, and social benefits associated with higher griddedness. Since griddedness was associated with particular times in history (post-1780s, pre-1940s), I wondered if there were other factors contributing to the increased use of active transportation and increased social dynamism of streets. In those decades, horses, streetcars, and walking were the dominant ways of navigating the city, and as such, these cities may be more compact, pedestrian friendly, and dynamic due to their past. Overall, the scientific approach of this paper really complemented the many readings of my transportation history course, and I appreciated its contributions to the transportation field.
